# The Polkadot Playbook

Simple, accurate answers to common questions about Polkadot, backed by extensive references and source material, empowering anyone to become a Polkadot ambassador.

## What is Polkadot?

- Polkadot is a scaling solution for Web3 applications and services.[^1]
- Polkadot scales through data and execution sharding, allowing for parallelized execution of parachains, called **Para**chains.[^2]
- Polkadot provides shared security and secure interoperability to Parachains.[^3]
  - Each of these shared is called a "Core", and Polkadot's anologous term for blockspace is core-time.
- Polkadot creates abundant, flexible, and high quality blockspace.[^4]
- Polkadot uses a novel "cynical" rollup to provide fast finality while using minimal resources.[^5]
- Polkadot 2.0 makes cores more performant, flexible, and cost-effective, through async-backing, agile-coretime and elastic scaling respectively.
- Polkadot JAM makes the type of applications that can be written on Polkadot cores radically less-opinionated, among other novel advancements.

## What things can you do on Polkadot, as you can do as a sovereign Rollup on ETH?

- Build applications with full control over block construction and transaction execution.[^21]
- Build application that can benefit from varying forms of scheduling -- not being bound by "transactions" to interact.  
- Build applications which execute at sub-second speeds.[^24]

## What "_unique_" things can you do on Polkadot, as a cynical Rollup?

- Build applications with full control over fees, fee payments, and tokens.[^22]
- Build applications which dynamically scale up and down execution cores.[^23]
- Build applications that can permissionlessly upgrade and evolve over time.[^25]
- Build cross chain communication, without worrying about the know weakest-link issue[^35]. 

## Why choose Polkadot?

- Billions of dollars of economic security provided to itself and applications running on it.[^31]
- Fast finalization times, on average under 30 seconds.[^32]
- Executing and scaling on standard "gaming" hardware.[^33]
- Polkadot SDK is the most robust and flexible blockchain framework.[^34]
- Secure cross-chain interoperability through trustless bridging protocols.[^35]

## Where is Polkadot leading?

- 50+ active rollups live on Polkadot driving 13M transactions across 300K active accounts per month on average.[^41]
- Among the highest Nakamoto coefficients in the blockchain ecosystem.[^42]
- 2nd largest developer community after Ethereum.[^43]
- Blazing fast execution speeds compared to other blockchain VMs.[^44]
- One of the largest functioning DAOs, managing the functionality of the network and tens of millions of dollars in assets for development.[^45]

## How Polkadot is better than...

- Ethereum: Polkadot realized Ethereum's scaling vision first, conceived and delivered by co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood.[^51]
- Solana: Unlike Solana, Polkadot scales without compromising Web3 principles of decentralization and security.[^52]
- Cosmos: Unlike Cosmos, Polkadot provides shared security and secure interoperability.[^53]
- Avalanche: Subnets in Avalanche are not as flexible as applications on Polkadot, and subnets do not provide shared security or secure interoperability.[^54]
- Layer 2s: Layer 2 solutions face performance issues, unpredictable fees, and fragmented interoperability due to non-native support for rollups.[^55]

## Appendix

More ideas on how we can make the playbook more comprehensive. probably these can go into separate, more verbose writeups. 

### The Layer Story

The story of how Polkadot can be seen as L0, oe L1. 
JAM is `L-[whatever_is_polkadot] - 1`

### Coretime vs. Blockspace 

Because Polkadot's novel in-core and on-chain dualism, the word blockspace is not accurate. Polkadot's pure output as a global computer is two flavors: In-core, and on-chain, and therefore we use the specialized term Coretime instead of Blockspace. 

To be more accurate, with JAM, Polkadot's outputs will be:

1. In-core compute
2. onchain compute
3. DA Ephemeral data
4. Onchain persistent data
5. Speed of data transfer between `outside_world <> in_core <> DA <> onchain`

### Rent 

Articulate exactly why Polkadot is inevitably has a notion of rent. Cynical. Polkadot validator's are proactively checking your work, unlike optimistic L2s, where in the absence of fraud, validators do nothing. This proactive ness CANNOT be free. The clear upside of this is significantly faster time-to-finality (30s vs 2w). 

### Bullish 

Which areas of Polkadot we are bullish on as an ambassador. 

1. Driven by arguably the most active founder in the Web3 space, Gaving wood.
	* Proven track record predicting where innovation happens: Polkadot preached Multi-chain in 2018
2. PoP, the first of its kind in solving the personhood issue in Web3, solving the oracle problem at its purest form.

3. JAM


TODO: better evidence about Solana. Why is it really bad? 
TODO: Near also has some kind of sharding in place, not sure if it is flexible.

[^5]: Polkadot's cynical rollup protocol is called ELVES.
	- ELVES stands for ”endorsing light validity evaluator system”.

[^21]: For example:
	- Build applications more resilient to MEV.
	- Build applications which can prioritize certain tasks and processes.
	- Build applications which only execute when it is economical to do so.

[^22]: For example:
	- Build applications where end-users pay no transaction fees.
	- Build applications which can accept fees paid in any token.
	- Build applications where users need not hold DOT or your native token to hold other tokens.

[^32]: Learn more about cynical rollups:
	- Compare that to optimistic rollups which may take up to a week to finalize!
	- Cynical rollups actively check that a block is valid, rather than waiting for someone to report it is invalid. See ELVES paper footnote above.

[^34]: Polkadot SDK is used throughout the entire blockchain ecosystem:
	- Polkadot and Kusama are built with the Polkadot SDK.
	- All 50+ live parachains, and many more in development, all use Polkadot SDK.
	- Many projects outside of Polkadot also use the Polkadot SDK: [Avail](https://www.availproject.org/), [Cardano](https://midnight.network/), [Entropy](https://entropy.xyz/), and more...

	- https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-comparisons-ethereum-2
	- Ethereum abandoned a properly sharded approach due to its complexity.
	- Ethereum now depends on layer 2 solutions that are fragmented, less secure, and less decentralized.

[^52]: Solana is better described as a distributed database, than a Web3 product.
	- Information about the scalability trilemma: https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/vision/
	- Solana scales vertically while Polkadot scales horizontally.
